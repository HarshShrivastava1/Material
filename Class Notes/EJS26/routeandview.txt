render method is used for sending view(ejs) to browser in particular route
res./req.rander("pagename")

route -> the path where the particular file(ejs/view/messgae) opens

Ex:-
route :- MP//UP//Bihar//Jk//Manipur//Rajisthan -----> diff raste
views:-lack//rodes//construction//Sikare//tribes//culture --->diff views accosiate with that path called route

view -> path and ejs is predefined in app js therefore when we use render we dont't put ".ejs" and "path name"

whenever we send any kind of data for e.g. text/multimedia/url we'll get the data in "req" of the same route.
//req.render(view [, locals] [, callback])

and whenever we want to send the data to client/frontend/browser we will send with the help of "res"
//res.render(viewName, { req : req, res : res /* other models */};

APni BhasA mE

req :- jab hame backend se frontEnd me data bhejna hota h tb req use krte h 
//req.render(view [, locals] [, callback])

res :- jab hame frontend se backEnd me data bhejna hota h tb req use krte h 
//res.render(view [, locals] [, callback])

we need to mannually refresh server when we change ".js/server file" in order to change the file automatically we user nodemon


"lookup view" error is faced when we do not have matching page name written in render("pagename")
"Not Found" error is faced when we do not have matching route ikn the ".js/server file"

npm install -g nodemon

-nodemon
-npx nodemon
